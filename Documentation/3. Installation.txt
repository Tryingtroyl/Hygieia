After installing from the 'prerequisites.txt' file, steps for setting up Hygieia are mentioned below:

1. Setup

    - Clone the below mentioned github repositories -
        https://github.com/hygieia/api.git
        https://github.com/hygieia/UI.git
    - Navigate to your UI folder and install the package dependencies by running 'npm install'.
    - Download Angular CLI by running 'npm install -g @angular/cli@8.0.3'.
    - Run 'ng version' to check your Angular CLI version and related package dependency versions (make sure the package versions are v8).

2. Build and run the executable file for the api

    - Navigate to the '\api' directory and run 'mvn clean install'.
    - This will create an output 'api.jar' file in the '\target' folder.
    - Make sure you set the configurable parameters in the 'api.properties' file to connect to the dashboard MongoDB database instance.
    - Navigate to 'api\target', and execute 'java -jar api.jar'

3. Build the Project

    - With the api running, open a different terminal and run 'ng build' in your '\UI' folder.

4. Development server

    - In the \UI folder, run 'ng serve' for a dev server.
    - Navigate to 'http://localhost:4200/' in a browser.
